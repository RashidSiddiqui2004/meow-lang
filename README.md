## 📜 MeowLang Syntax 🐈

🐱 Basic Structure

Every MeowLang program starts with "Hi Kitty" and ends with "Bye Kitty".

```
Hi Kitty
    meow x = 10;
    meow y = 20;
    purr(x + y);
Bye Kitty
```

🐾 Variable Declaration
Use meow to declare variables.

```
meow age = 5;
meow name = "Whiskers";
```


😺 Printing Output
Use purr() to print values.

```
purr("Hello, world!");
purr(42);
```

🧮 Arithmetic Operations
MeowLang supports basic arithmetic operations.

```
meow x = 10;
meow y = 5;
purr(x + y);  // Output: 15
purr(x * y);  // Output: 50
```

🐱 Bitwise Operations
MeowLang also supports bitwise operators.

```
meow a = 5;
meow b = 3;
purr(a & b);  // Bitwise AND
purr(a | b);  // Bitwise OR
```
